							<h3><i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>Expansion Plans</h3>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dhaneshwari Enterprises is looking to grow all over India and pan Asia. “We are looking for funding from venture capitalists for our three-year plan, to have our own hotels, Transport segment & Events  in the name of Dhaneshwari Groups,” stated Vinod. He is looking at about 4 hotels in Belagavi in the near future. “Next we would like to go to North India, in particular. We are looking at a heritage property and have interest in eco tourism,transport & Events. We would like to go to B cities and tourist places. Lot of enquiries are from destinations like Coorg, Chikmagalur and Ooty. However, we are being selective and particular about owners. We have created a brand name and do not want to spoil it. We want to give an international experience to Indian clients,” asserted by Vinod. <br/>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Vinod, DGroup is the only company in India giving minimum guarantee revenue for each property. “That is our USP. Of course it depends on the project, location, product and infrastructure. After inspection by our expert team we set the targets for minimum guarantee income. We deliver and take our consultation fee monthly,” he said, adding that the contract also includes day to day operations, HR, training, SOP, tie-up with OTAs and corporates, etc. <br/>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company is very strong in F&B – restaurants and banquet. Vinod urges through FHW that FHRAI should reach out to the tourism ministry and central government to get subsidy, and give industry standards to the hospitality sector and transport with Manpower crises
